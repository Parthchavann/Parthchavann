Building an LLM-powered career path platform using FastAPI, React, Supabase, and semantic search with FAISS & BERT.

🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on
AI/ML projects, real-time data apps, or GenAI tools that solve meaningful problems and have scalable impact.

🧠 I'm looking for help with
Advanced model fine-tuning, productionizing GenAI apps, and setting up cost-efficient cloud infra for ML pipelines.

🌱 I'm currently learning
RAG pipelines, MLOps with Airflow, Instructor-XL for embeddings, and multimodal GenAI tools like Gemini & Claude.

💬 Ask me about
Resume matching engines, LLM API integration, career assessment tools, or data science career strategy.

⚡ Fun fact
I once built a working ML prototype in 48 hours using OpenAI, Airtable, Vercel, and Postman — and deployed it live before the deadline.
